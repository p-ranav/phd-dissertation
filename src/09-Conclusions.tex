\chapter{Conclusions}

In this proposal, we have described the class of distributed real-time embedded software systems we are addressing. We have provided detailed descriptions and reviews of relevant related work, covering a wide range of analysis tool suites. We have also briefed about the DREMS infrastructure, the backbone of the proposed research and development. We have elaborated on the Colored Petri net-based timing analysis methodology, describing both the modeling aspects and analysis results. The subsequent sections describe some interesting  heuristics and modeling changes that greatly improved our analysis results, especially for distributed deployment scenarios. The remaining challenges within this scope include an experimental validation of the presented work and potential extensions to model and analyze Cyber-Physical systems.
