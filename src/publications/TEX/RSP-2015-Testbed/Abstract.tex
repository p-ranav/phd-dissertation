%We have created a testbed for the development and testing of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications.  This testbed incorporates smart network hardware which allows for high-fidelity emulation of the system's network characteristics, and simulation systems which allow for high-fidelity simulation of the CPS, its environment, its sensors, and its actuators.  We discuss the architecture of this testbed, the types of experiments and applications which can be run on the testbed, some of the testbed's limitations, and some extensions to the testbed. 

This paper describes a testbed for development, deployment, testing, and analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications. The testbed incorporates smart network hardware, allowing high-fidelity emulation of CPS network characteristics, and CPS simulation environments to enable high-frequency sensor reading, actuator control and physical environmental changes. We discuss the architecture of this testbed and present the types of experiments and applications which can be run to study hardware and software fault tolerance, software reconfiguration, and system stability characteristics in distributed real-time embedded systems. We also describe the scalability, limitations, and potential extensions to this testbed.
