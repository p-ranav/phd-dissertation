  Abstract                 = {As the bandwidth of CPUs and networks continues to grow, it becomes more attractive, for efficiency reasons, to share such resources among several applications with the minimum level of interference. This can be achieved using temporal partitions, with each application assigned to its own partition and executing as if it was executing alone on a resource with lower bandwidth. The partitions are associated to servers that execute the application tasks according to a given application-level scheduler. On the other hand, the set of servers is scheduled by a system-level scheduler. This paper addresses the particular case of fixed priorities-based application-level schedulers together with a periodic server model at the system level. It starts with an adequate response time analysis based on the notion of server availability for a known server. Then it addresses the inverse problem of designing a server with minimum system-level resource requirements to fulfill the application time constraints. In this context, the paper shows that response time based schedulability tests with linear time bounds do not need to consider all tasks but just a small subset, which may lead to substantial speed-ups. The proposed method goes a step further with respect to other recent works in the literature by considering a more complete task model, effectively computing the server parameters and establishing a better trade-off concerning complexity and tightness.},

Sophisticated$\backslash$nclassification, marking, policing, and shaping operations need only be$\backslash$nimplemented at network boundaries or hosts. Network resources are$\backslash$nallocated to traffic streams by service provisioning policies which$\backslash$ngovern how traffic is marked and conditioned upon entry to a$\backslash$ndifferentiated services-capable network, and how that traffic is$\backslash$nforwarded within that network.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a component-based modelling approach to
 system-software co-engineering of real-time embedded systems,
 in particular aerospace systems. Our method is centred around
 the standardized Architecture Analysis and Design Language
 (AADL) modelling framework. We formalize a significant subset
 of AADL, incorporating its recent Error Model Annex for
 modelling faults and repairs. The major distinguishing
 aspects of this component-based approach are the possibility
 to describe nominal hardware and software operations, hybrid
 (and timing) aspects, as well as probabilistic faults and
 their propagation and recovery. Moreover, it supports dynamic
 (i.e. on-the-fly) reconfiguration of components and
 inter-component connections. The operational semantics gives
 a precise interpretation of specifications by providing a
 mapping onto networks of event-data automata. These networks
 are then subject to different kinds of formal analysis such
 as model checking, safety and dependability analysis and
 performance evaluation. Mature tool support realizes these
 analyses. The activities reported in this paper are carried
 out in the context of the correctness, modelling, and
 performance of aerospace systems, project which is funded by
 the European Space Agency.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a programming model called PTIDES (Programming Temporally Integrated Distributed Embedded Systems), that extends the discrete-event model of computation with a carefully chosen relationship between real time and model time. PTIDES provides a framework for exploring a family of execution strategies for distributed embedded systems. Our objective in this paper is to present an execution strategy that 1) allows independent events to be processed out of time stamp order, 2) uses clock synchronization as a replacement for null message communication across distributed platforms, 3) defines a notion of when events are safe to process and 4) presents an implementation of a PTIDES model. This work puts forward an execution strategy that is aggressive in concurrent execution of events.},

  Abstract                 = {While traditional design time and offline approaches of testing and verification do cover a lot of ground in improving and ensuring high reliability, they may not cover all possible fault scenarios that a system could encounter at runtime. Thus, runtime 'health management' of complex embedded software systems is required to improve their dependability. Our approach to Software Health Management uses concepts from the field of `Systems Health Management': detection, diagnosis and mitigation. While our earlier work focused on a reactive mitigation strategy specified using a timed state machine model, this paper describes a deliberative mitigation engine that relies on a function-allocation model to identify alternative component-assembly configurations that can restore the functions needed for the goals of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {$\backslash$nExperience with wired networks has provides guidance about what level$\backslash$nof detail is appropriate for simulation-based protocol studies.$\backslash$nWireless simulations raise many new questions about appropriate levels$\backslash$nof detail in simulation models for radio propagation and energy$\backslash$nconsumption. This paper describes the trade-offs associated with$\backslash$nadding detail to simulation models. We evaluate the effects of detail$\backslash$nin five case studies of wireless simulations for protocol design.$\backslash$nUltimately the researcher must judge what level of detail is required$\backslash$nfor a given question, but we suggest two approaches to cope with$\backslash$nvarying levels of detail. When error is not correlated, networking$\backslash$nalgorithms that are robust to a range of errors are often stressed in$\backslash$nsimilar ways by random error as by detailed models. We also suggest$\backslash$nvisualization techniques that can help pinpoint incorrect details and$\backslash$nmanage detail overload.$\backslash$n},

  Abstract                 = {We present an analytical framework for formulating partition configuration problems in real-time systems with dependencies, particularly applicable to modeling systems with multiple criticality or security levels. Partition configuration constraints for real-time tasks include affinity and conflict. We also discuss the application of the framework to arbitrary partition schedulers, harmonic partition execution, and round robin partition execution (which is particularly problematic). Our interest is in minimizing end-to-end latency, though the computational complexity of the problem

prevents us from finding optimal results. We conclude with some open problems},

  Abstract                 = {Today's wireless sensor networks (WSN) focus on energy-efficiency as the main metric to optimize. However, an increasing number of scenarios where sensor networks are considered for time-critical purposes in application scenarios like intrusion detection, industrial monitoring, or health care systems demands for an explicit support of performance guarantees in WSNs and, thus, in turn for a respective mathematical framework. In (J. Schmitt and U. Roedig, 2005) , a sensor network calculus was introduced in order to accommodate a worst-case analysis of WSNs. This sensor network calculus focused on the communication aspect in WSNs, but had not yet a possibility to treat in-network processing in WSNs. In this work, we now incorporate in-network processing features as they are typical for WSNs by taking into account computational resources on the sensor nodes. Furthermore, we propose a simple, yet effective priority queue management discipline which achieves a good balance of response times across sensor nodes in the field.},
