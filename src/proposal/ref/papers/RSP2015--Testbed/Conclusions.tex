\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}
In this paper we have described a testbed architecture and implementation which enables researchers and developers to quickly prototype and develop distributed CPS applications and analyze their performance with hardware-in-the-loop simulation on networks which emulate the real system's networks.  We have described with a few examples the types of experiments which this testbed can support and shown integration with multiple different simulators.  Further, we have analyzed the limitations of this testbed for application to certain systems and applications.  Finally, we have covered some proposed work for improving the testbed and testing framework in the future through further analysis and extensions to the testbed.
