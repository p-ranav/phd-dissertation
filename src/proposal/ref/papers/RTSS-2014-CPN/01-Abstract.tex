Distributed Real-Time Embedded (DRE) Systems that address safety and mission-critical system requirements are applied in a variety of domains today. Complex, integrated systems like managed satellite clusters expose heterogeneous concerns such as strict timing requirements, complexity in system integration, deployment, and repair; and resilience to faults. Integrating appropriate modeling and analysis techniques into the design of such systems helps ensure predictable, dependable and safe operation upon deployment. 

In this paper, we present a Colored Petri net-based approach to modeling and analysis of component-based software applications for enabling the verification of system properties such as lack of deadline violations. The approach is based on (1) formalizing the component operation scheduling using Colored Petri nets (CPN), (2) modeling the abstract temporal behavior of application components, and (3) integrating the business logic and the component operation scheduling models into a concrete CPN, which is then analyzed. This model-driven approach enables a verification-driven workflow wherein the application model can be refined and restructured before actual code development. Thereafter, the abstract temporal behavior of the application components provide the necessary guidelines for the application developers to structure their code.

This approach also addresses the need to model the temporal behavior of the applications under some level of abstraction and integrating it into the design of the underlying components. The developer's knowledge on the component execution code will further enable validation of scheduling constraints that are inherent in such real-time systems.
