Robot Operating System (ROS) is one of few preferred and widely accepted platforms to develop large-scale robotics applications. ROS provides a light-weight middleware framework and a variety of command-line tools to quickly prototype and execute interacting processes. However, much of the development process with ROS can still be automated and there is a need for development tool suites that are easily accessible and that, using model-driven development principles, can provide for a rich set of design-time features such as modeling, code generation, analysis, deployment and process monitoring along with run-time support for general fault management. 

The ROSMOD toolsuite presented in this paper supports all these capabilities, as shown in our case study. However, one of the most important aspects of such development tools is the often neglected support for analysis, which is especially relevant in safety-critical real-time systems. Our current work aims at integrating our existing model-driven analysis tools into ROSMOD to support not only a wider range of systems but also a larger user group.

%We have evaluated the usability of ROSMOD by prototyping a sample recovery robot for the NASA competition.
