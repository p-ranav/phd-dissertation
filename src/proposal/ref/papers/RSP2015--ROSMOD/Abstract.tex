	This paper presents ROSMOD, a model-driven component-based development tool suite for the Robot Operating System (ROS). ROSMOD is well suited for the design, development and deployment of large scale distributed applications on embedded hardware devices. We present the various features of ROSMOD including the modeling language, the graphical user interface, code generators and deployment infrastructure. We describe the utility of this tool with a real-world case study - An Autonomous Ground Support Equipment (AGSE) robot that was designed and prototyped using ROSMOD for the NASA Student Launch competition, 2014-2015.
