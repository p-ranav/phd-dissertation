Mobile, distributed real-time systems operating in dynamic environments, and running mission-critical applications must satisfy strict timing requirements to operate safely. To reduce the development and integration complexity for such systems, component-based design models are being increasingly used. Appropriate analysis models are required to study the structural and behavioral complexity in such designs. 

This paper presents a Colored Petri net-based approach to capture the architecture and temporal behavior of such component-based applications for both qualitative and quantitative schedulability analysis. The analysis method is modular, extensible and intuitive and there are sufficient support tools to enable state space analysis and verification for medium to large size design models. We have  investigated the challenges faced in preemptive and non-preemptive hierarchical scheduling schemes and the effect of component interaction patterns on real-time thread execution. 


%This analysis model includes a compact, scalable representation of high-level design, accounting for the dynamics of real-time thread execution while exploiting knowledge of component execution code. Exhaustive state space search enables verification and validation of useful and necessary system properties, reducing development costs and increasing reliability for such time-critical systems. The utility of this tool has been illustrated with several examples.
