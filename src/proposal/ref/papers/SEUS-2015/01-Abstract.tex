\begin{abstract}
Integrated analysis of temporal behavior for distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems is an important design-time step needed to verify safe and predictable system operation at run-time. In earlier work, we have shown a Colored Petri Net-based (CPN) approach to modeling and analyzing component-based DRE systems. In this paper, we present new CPN-based modeling approaches and advanced state space methods that improve on the scalability and efficiency of the analysis. The generality of the modeling principles used show the applicability of this approach to a wide range of systems.
