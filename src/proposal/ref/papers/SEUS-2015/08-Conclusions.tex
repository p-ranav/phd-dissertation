Mobile, distributed real-time systems operating in dynamic networking environments, and running mission-critical applications must still satisfy strict timing requirements to operate safely. To reduce the development and integration complexity for such systems, component-based design models are being increasingly used. Appropriate analysis models are required to study the structural and behavioral complexity in such designs. 

This paper presented new and improved Colored Petri net-based modeling approaches to capture the architecture and temporal behavior of such component-based applications for both qualitative and quantitative schedulability analysis. The key idea behind the analysis is the precise modeling of the component execution semantics in the analysis tool. The analysis method is modular, extensible and intuitive and there are sufficient support tools to enable state space analysis and verification for medium to large size design models. We investigated the utility of structural reduction and advanced state space analysis techniques in order to realize a more efficient and scalable analysis.
