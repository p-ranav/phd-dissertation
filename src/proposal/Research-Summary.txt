Distributed Real-Time Embedded (DRE) Systems that address safety and mission-critical system requirements are applied in a variety of domains today. Complex, integrated systems e.g. industrial robotics, printing press, power grids, automotive engineering, and flight software deployments expose heterogeneous concerns such as strict timing requirements, complexity in system integration, deployment, and repair; and resilience to faults. Integrating appropriate modeling and analysis techniques into the design of such systems helps ensure predictable, dependable and safe operation upon deployment. The proposed work describes how we can model and analyze distributed component-based applications in order to verify system timing properties such as lack of deadline violations, and deadlocks. Our approach relies on formalizing component-based applications using Colored Petri Nets (CPN) i.e. modeling the component assembly, operation scheduling, thread execution etc. and analyzing the temporal behavior of the overall system using state space analysis and model checking techniques. This model-driven approach enables a verification-driven workflow where the system requirements are verified at each stage of the design. The proposal discusses improvements to our analysis approach, including advanced state space analysis methods applied to improve scalability and efficiency of the analysis. The generality of the modeling principles used show the applicability of this method to a wide range of similar systems.
